# OpenAI Website Clone 🚀

A pixel-perfect, front-end replica of [OpenAI.com](https://openai.com), built entirely from scratch using semantic HTML5 and modern CSS3. 

This mini-project was developed to master foundational web development concepts, specifically focusing on advanced CSS layouts (Flexbox/Grid), responsive design, and replicating high-tier, minimalist user interfaces without relying on external frameworks.

## 📑 Pages Recreated
To deeply understand the architecture of a modern tech website, this project goes beyond a single landing page and reconstructs three core pages:

1. **Home Page (`index.html`)**
   * Replicated the hero section, minimalist navigation, and dynamic grid layouts.
2. **Research Page (`research.html`)**
   * Structured text-heavy content, utilising CSS Grid to display article thumbnails and updates in a clean, masonry-style layout.
3. **For Business (`business.html`)**
   * Recreated distinct enterprise-focused UI components, callout boxes, and custom feature lists.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Concepts Applied
* **HTML5:** Semantic structuring (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, `<article>`) for improved accessibility and SEO.
* **CSS3:** * Advanced **Flexbox** & **CSS Grid** for complex, responsive component placement.
  * Custom variables (`:root`) for consistent colour theming and typography.
  * Media queries (`@media`) to ensure a seamless experience across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
* **No Frameworks:** Built 100% vanilla to strengthen core front-end logic.
